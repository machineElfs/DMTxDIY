This code runs the DMT extended state machine
Hardware consists of Rpi connected to a Evolv DNA200 board 
which fires up the RDTA inside the face mask.

The firing is controlled by the program and takes input 
from two barometric sensors inside the face mask to assure
that the vaporization is only triggered during inhalations.

It Works!!!
