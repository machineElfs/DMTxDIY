TO-DO LIST

change the design of the mask adapter so the internal pressure sensor
is at the air entrance. This way it could be reading the pressure AND the 
temperature of the incoming air to more accuratelly determine inhalations.

in sensorsRun.py in the def run add a counter of sucsesfull  burns to 
prevent multiple burns within the time the sensors are reading

major rethink of the sensors. Use one sensor inside the mask reading at
the highest precission (8-10 ms) and use another sensor next to the 
RPi only reading once before the autofiring. Compare the more precise 
internal meassurement to a fixed value from the RPi sensor.
